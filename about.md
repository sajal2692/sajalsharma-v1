  Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on adding more content, in the form of additional projects, a blog, and a home page revamp. So there's more to look forward to. :)

### Me

Hi, I'm Sajal.

I hail from New Delhi, India. Though, I have spent a couple of the past few years in Melbourne, Australia where I completed a Master of Information Technology degree from The University of Melbourne, Australia's most prestigious university.

I currently live in Pune, working as a Data Scientist at Unscrambl, Inc, where I lead the Chatbot development team! We're a kick-ass startup bringing real-time, intelligent, and interactive analytics to different verticals including telecommunications, healthcare, and banking. When I'm not trying to build the world from the move _Her_, I use statistics and machine learning to solve our customer's analytics problems, and incorporate predictive models in Unscrambl's flagship product, *Drive*. Being a jack of all trades, sometimes I also build front-end applications, dashboards and visualisations to help our customers interact with our data products. You do need good storytelling for good data. ;)

In the past I've worked as a Technical Lead in a service oriented startup, <em>Energy Umpire</em> based in Melbourne, Victoria.

So yeah, I have my fair share of startup experience, and the usual get sh*t done attitude that comes with it.

I'm also <em>really</em> into indie rock, creative writing, travelling, and caffeine. I cycle between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons. Also trying to learn German (the language) and how to play the guitar!

### What I know

As a result of my perpetual curiosity, I have practical experience with a wide range of technologies including:

Python • R • Ruby • Java • Javascript • ReactJS • AngularJS • HTML • CSS • Bootstrap • NodeJS • Jquery • MySQL • MongoDB • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy

for use with concepts such as:

Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Analytics, Statistical Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, Database Systems & Information Modelling • Software Engineering • Web Application Development, <em>and more!</em>

Thankfully, I'm not a cat.

### Certificates I've completed:

To feed my hunger for learning, I take online courses for different Data Science topics and work independently on projects in my free time. Some of them include:

* Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - by Kaggle and Google - Udacity
* Statistics Specialization: Introduction to Probability and Data - by Duke University - Coursera
* Statistics Specialization: Inferential Statistics - by Duke University - Coursera
* Big Data Foundations, including Hadoop and Spark - by IBM - Big Data University
* Data Science and Machine Learning with R - Udemy
* Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp - Udemy
* React Nanodegree - Udacity (why? because I like being woke!)

Check out my [portfolio](/portfolio) to see iPython notebooks and Github repos for some of the projects I've worked on.
