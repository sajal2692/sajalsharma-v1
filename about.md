  Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on adding more content, in the form of additional projects, a blog, and a home page revamp. So there's more to look forward to. :)

### Me

Hi, I'm Sajal.

I hail from New Delhi, India. Though, I have spent a couple of the past few years in Melbourne, Australia where I completed a Master of Information Technology degree from The University of Melbourne, Australia's most prestigious university.

I currently live in Pune, working as a Data Scientist at Unscrambl, Inc. We're a kick-ass startup where each of us give it our best to bring real-time, streaming, intelligent analytics to different verticals including telecommunications, healthcare, and banking. I use statistics and machine learning to solve our customer's analytics problems, and incorporating predictive models in Unscrambl's flagship product, *Drive*. Being a jack of all trades, I also build front-end applications, dashboards and visualisations to help our customers interact with our data products. You do need good storytelling for good data. ;)

In the past I've worked as a Technical Lead in a service oriented startup, <em>Energy Umpire</em> based in Melbourne, Victoria.

So yeah, I have my fair share of startup experience, and the usual get sh*t done attitude that comes with it.

I'm also <em>really</em> into indie rock, creative writing, travelling, and caffeine. I cycle between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons.

Python • R • Ruby • Java • Javascript • AngularJS • HTML • CSS • Bootstrap • NodeJS • Jquery • MySQL • MongoDB • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy

for use with concepts such as:

Thankfully, I'm not a cat.

To feed my hunger for learning, I take online courses for different Data Science topics and work independently on projects in my free time. Some of them include:

* Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - by Kaggle and Google - Udacity
* Statistics Specialization: Introduction to Probability and Data - by Duke University - Coursera
* Statistics Specialization: Inferential Statistics - by Duke University - Coursera
* Big Data Foundations, including Hadoop and Spark - by IBM - Big Data University
