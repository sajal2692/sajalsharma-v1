  Hey there! Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on adding more content, in the form of additional projects and a blog. So there's more to look forward to. :)

### Me

I'm Sajal. 

I hail from New Delhi, India. Though, I have spent the majority of my past few years in Melbourne, Australia where I completed a Master of Information Technology degree from The University of Melbourne, Australia's most prestigious university. 

I currently work remotely, as a Technical Lead in a service oriented startup, <em>Energy Umpire</em> based in Melbourne, Victoria. My roles range from that of a Software Engineer, developing web applications to optimise key business processes, to a Growth Analyst, analysing customer engagement data and suggesting growth strategies in a dynamic fast-paced work environment.

I'm also <em>really</em> into indie music, creative writing, travelling, and caffeine.

### What I know

As a result of my perpetual curiosity, I have practical experience with a wide range of technologies including:

Python • R • Ruby • Java • Javascript • HTML • CSS • Bootstrap • NodeJS • Jquery • MySQL • MongoDB • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy

for use with concepts such as:

Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Analytics, Statistical Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, Database Systems & Information Modelling • Software Engineering • Web Application Development, <em>and more!</em>

Currently I'm working on brushing up my Big Data skills, and applying Machine Learning models to real world problems.

### Certificates I've completed:

To feed my hunger for learning, I take online courses for different Data Science topics and work independently on projects in my free time. Some of them include:

* Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - by Kaggle and Google - Udacity
* Statistics Specialization: Introduction to Probability and Data - by Duke University - Coursera
* Statistics Specialization: Inferential Statistics - by Duke University - Coursera
* Big Data Foundations, including Hadoop and Spark - by IBM - Big Data University
* Data Science and Machine Learning with R - Udemy
