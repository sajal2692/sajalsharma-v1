  Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on adding more content, in the form of additional projects, a blog, and a home page revamp. So there's more to look forward to. :)

### Me

Hi, I'm Sajal.

I hail from New Delhi, India. Though, I have spent a couple of the past few years in Melbourne, Australia where I completed a Master of Information Technology degree from The University of Melbourne, Australia's most prestigious university.

I currently live in Pune, working as a Data Scientist at Unscrambl, Inc. We're a kick-ass startup where each of us give it our best to bring real-time, streaming, intelligent analytics to different verticals including telecommunications, healthcare, and banking. I use statistics and machine learning to solve our customer's analytics problems, and incorporating predictive models in Unscrambl's flagship product, *Drive*. Being a jack of all trades, I also build front-end applications, dashboards and visualisations to help our customers interact with our data products. You do need good storytelling for good data. ;)

In the past I've worked as a Technical Lead in a service oriented startup, <em>Energy Umpire</em> based in Melbourne, Victoria.

So yeah, I have my fair share of startup experience, and the usual get sh*t done attitude that comes with it.

I'm also <em>really</em> into indie rock, creative writing, travelling, and caffeine. I cycle between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons.
